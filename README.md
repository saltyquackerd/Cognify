# Cognify
Katherine Liang, Hailey Lin, Iris Xu, and Tiffany Zhang

Cognify is our AI-powered active learning assistant that integrates novel recall learning methods with freeform learning, where we ask the user a question for understanding and evaluate their response on a sidebar of our chat platform. To prevent shallow learning, we included strict learning that prevents the user from sending another message until the user has responded to the question. We also feature a knowledge graph that shows all the topics a user has learned with Cognify. We hope to extend education AI apps to everyone who uses AI for learning, not just students.
